# YtSplit

This is a script which allows you to split videos based on Youtube timestamps. Simply copy a set of timestamps into a text file in chronological order, and the program will split the video into a new video between the timestamps.

Requires FFMPEG to work. `--download` requires youtube-dl too.

(by the way, I am the --global in commit history. I realized that I misconfigured git a little too late, and don't feel like [fixing it](https://github.com/jayphelps/git-blame-someone-else) at this moment in time)
